How to prove this works as intended:
1. Start a new, Factory Default Blend file in Blender
2. In Blender, open the add-on that you found in this folder
3. Run the add-on
4. Go back to the Layout
5. On the right of the 3D view there should be a tab labelled "Serial" now
6. Open the Serial tab
7. Open the Receiving Panel Sub-Panel
8. Press the "Add to Panel" Operator a couple of times to add items to the ListBox at the bottom of the Receiving Sub-Panel (DON'T TOUCH THE OTHER BUTTONS YET)
9. Change the Integer value in the ListBox (the 2nd column has those)

Now, somehow, use that Integer value to drive the value of the default cube's x rotation.
